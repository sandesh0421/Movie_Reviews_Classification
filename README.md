# Movie review classification
Classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative using sentiment analysis libraries in python

# Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis refers to the use of Natural language processing (NLP), text analysis and computation to systematically extract, identify and classify information into specific categories. This project uses **Gaussian Naive bayes** and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** models from sklearn library in python

# Naive Bayes classifiers
Naive Bayes classifiers are a group of supervised ML algorithms under the scikit learn library in python. They use a **feature matrix** (vectors of all dependent variables) to predict a **class variable** (output for each row in feature matrix). These algorithms work on the assumption that all features are independent of each other and have equal importance.

In **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier, the distributions of features follows a Gaussian/Normal distribution and forms a bell-shaped graph.
In **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier, feature vectors represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial distribution. This classifier is ideal for word counts in text classification

# About
This project reads reviews from a tsv file. After requiste clean up using regular expressions, MNB classification algorithm is applied to the dataset.The deployed web app takes user input for a review and classifies it as positive/negative

# Libraries used
Refer to **requirements.txt** to see which libraries are necessary to run the code
